# VPlotter
This is my attempt to create yet another vplotter. This plotter is inspired by the work of [andywise](https://github.com/andywise/drawbot) and 
[homofaciens](https://homofaciens.de/index_en.htm) 


## How does this thing work?
Remember this guy [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras)? Plotter works on one of his theorem. "In a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal [to the sum of] the squares of the two other sides". Ring any bells?

We will soon see why this "theorem" useful. But before that lets take a look at the hardware and then we will talk about the "theory".
The hardware consists of the following

* 2 Stepper Motors (28byj-48)
* 2 [EasyDriver](http://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/index.html) Boards
* Raspberry pi Zero W
* SG90 micro servo

So why is this "theorem" useful here? Lets back up and think about what we are trying to achieve here. We want to build a plotter which can draw a vector image. Now lets take a look at the hardware.





This means that we have to convert the vector image to something that the plotter can understand.
